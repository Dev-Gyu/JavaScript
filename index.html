      <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
        is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified
        by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
        which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
        [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
        and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published
        by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
        which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.</p>
